## üõí E-Commerce Sales Analysis with SQL & Python
This portfolio project showcases a complete analysis of an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python, focusing on business intelligence, insights extraction, and data storytelling. The project is divided into two parts ‚Äî SQL-driven data exploration and Python-based data visualization and analysis ‚Äî providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior and sales performance.

## Project Files
* Ecommerce_SQL+Python.ipynb:
* Data extraction and manipulation using SQL, followed by Python-based analysis.

* EcommerceProject.ipynb:
* Full exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and insights in Python.

## Objective
To analyze the performance of an e-commerce platform and derive insights into:

* Sales trends over time

* Customer segmentation

* Product performance

* Revenue generation by location and product type

* Returns and refund patterns

## Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Description
* SQL (SQLite)	Used to query and join data tables for preliminary data extraction
* Python	Data cleaning, EDA, and visualization
* Pandas	Data manipulation and wrangling
* Matplotlib & Seaborn	Data visualization and pattern recognition
* Jupyter Notebook	Interactive environment for combining code, results, and documentation

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains order records from an e-commerce platform with fields including:

* Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, Product Category

* Sales, Profit, Quantity, Region, Shipping Mode, Return Status

üîç Key Features & Insights
## Part 1: SQL + Python Integration
* Connected SQL queries directly into Python using sqlite3 to extract filtered, grouped, and aggregated results.

## Answered business questions such as:

1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Find the total sales per category.
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state. 
6. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
7. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
8. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
9. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
10. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.
11. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
12. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
13. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
14. Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
15. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python
* Time-series trend analysis on monthly sales and profit.

* Bar plots and heatmaps for:

* Top performing products

* Customer buying patterns

* Category-wise revenue

* Geographic distribution of sales using location-based charts.

* Identification of high-return rate categories to suggest improvements.

## Business Recommendations
* Invest more in the Consumer and Corporate segments due to higher revenue generation.

* Focus marketing efforts in Western and Eastern regions.

* Review refund policies for Technology and Office Supplies categories.

* Optimize shipping strategies based on delivery modes' impact on returns.


## Future Improvements
* Integrate Power BI or Tableau dashboards for interactive reporting.

* Apply machine learning models for sales prediction.

* Create customer churn or lifetime value models.
